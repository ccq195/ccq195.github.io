Short Bio
======
I am a postdoc in the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, advised by Prof. [Mang Ye (叶茫)](https://marswhu.github.io/index.html) and Prof. [Bo Du (杜博)](http://sigma.whu.edu.cn/resource.php). My research interest includes person re-identification, sketch-photo recognition, and multi-modal learning. 

I graduated from the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China with a doctor's degree, advised by Prof. [Meibin Qi (齐美彬)](https://dsp.hfut.edu.cn/main.htm). I received my bachelor’s degree from Fuyang Normal University, Fuyang, China.
